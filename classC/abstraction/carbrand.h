    abstraction refers to the concept of hiding the complex implemnetation 
    details and showing only the essential features of an object.
    Encapsulation, on the other hand, involves bundling the data and methods
    that operate on the data and methos that restricting access to some of the
    object's components. 
    So, abstraction focuses on the outside view of an object, while encapsulation 
    focuses on the internal organization of an object
